## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

Ultimately, this bot was made on a Saturday night because I was bored.

## Built With

* [bancho.js](https://github.com/ThePooN/bancho.js)

## Getting Started

To get a copy up and running follow these simple steps.
**DISCLAIMER**
Do not make a new account to run a bot.
That is considered **multiaccounting** and is banable.
Visit the [osu! wiki](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Bot_account) for more information.

### Prerequisites

This bot uses [oppai](https://github.com/Francesco149/oppai) for beatmap info and pp calculation.

On windows you can download the executable file and drop it in the project's working directory.

For linux users, download the latest binaries for your OS from oppai's repository, extract the archive and place the executable in the project's working directory.
